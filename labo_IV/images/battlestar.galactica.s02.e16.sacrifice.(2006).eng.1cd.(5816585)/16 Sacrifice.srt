1
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:24,688
Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

2
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,859
Hi, we're...
We're kind of lost, again.

3
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,237
We're trying to get
to the CIC. Could you...

4
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,697
No talking, no talking, please.

5
00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:35,449
No cheating.
Hold it up, a little higher.

6
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:41,955
Sneaky. Eight, nine...

7
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:43,290
Start again.
You aren't serious.

8
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:43,791
Zero...

9
00:00:53,593 --> 00:00:58,593
I've asked you here to find out
why the Cylons hate us so much.

10
00:00:58,723 --> 00:01:01,225
It's what you said
at the ceremony.

11
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:04,061
That humanity
was a flawed creation.

12
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:07,606
And that people still
kill one another

13
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:10,234
for petty jealousy and greed.

14
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:15,235
You said that humanity never asked
itself why it deserved to survive.

15
00:01:16,282 --> 00:01:20,327
Maybe you don't.

16
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:28,665
Sleeper agents
within the Fleet.

17
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:35,421
Takeover by brute force.

18
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:40,681
Cylon impregnation

19
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:45,682
and reproduction.

20
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:52,150
Multiple models.

21
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:57,151
Suicide bombings.

22
00:01:57,282 --> 00:01:59,533
Assault on

23
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:04,534
natural resources.

24
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:07,184
Speculation continues that
Galactica is harboring a Cylon agent.

25
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:10,103
Eyewitnesses claim to have seen
one of the known Cylon models

26
00:03:10,104 --> 00:03:12,189
moving in and out
of Galactica's brig.

27
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,150
Admiral Adama has made no
comment on this situation.

28
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:20,151
We will continue...

29
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:23,158
How the hell did this
get out to the press?

30
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,243
I'm surprised
it didn't happen sooner.

31
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:27,371
I'm told you've been
meeting with her regularly,

32
00:03:27,372 --> 00:03:30,165
allowing her to interact
with members of your crew.

33
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:34,670
She's a military asset providing us
with vital strategic intelligence.

34
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:37,923
While we pray that she's not somehow
colluding with other Cylons.

35
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:42,177
If I felt for one second that she posed
some kind of a threat to this Fleet,

36
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:43,970
I'd pull the trigger
on her myself.

37
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:48,971
I think the Fleet may need
to hear that, Admiral.

38
00:03:51,688 --> 00:03:54,398
Even more,
they need to believe it.

39
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,483
Someone took their vitamin
this morning.

40
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:58,110
Yeah, I don't know
what got into me.

41
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:59,444
No, you're right.

42
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:02,364
Keeping Sharon Valerii alive,
allowing her pregnancy to continue,

43
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:04,449
there is no road map
for any of this.

44
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,494
Somebody, somebody has got to
keep asking the hard questions.

45
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:08,578
I agree.

46
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:10,664
I want to stay ahead of this.
Acknowledge the Cylon's existence

47
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:14,251
and then make some kind of case
for her to stay aboard Galactica.

48
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:15,544
I don't think
that's going to work.

49
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:16,670
What? Why?

50
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:18,547
I think you need
to trust the people.

51
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:20,215
Use the press,
tell them the truth.

52
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:22,718
I mean, we barely know
anything about the Cylons,

53
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:25,137
and until we learn more,
we're not gonna destroy

54
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:28,140
the only source of information
that we have. Period.

55
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:33,141
Good. That simple, huh?

56
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:33,854
Well...

57
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:40,610
Could I...
Could I have a minute?

58
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:44,781
Sure. Important?

59
00:04:44,782 --> 00:04:49,782
You were saying
about the hard questions.

60
00:04:50,663 --> 00:04:55,663
I know it's just my Debate Team
ring, but it's the best I could do.

61
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:03,337
This really isn't
how I planned it.

62
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,542
Anyway...

63
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,103
Billy...

64
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:19,107
I love you.

65
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:21,109
I've loved you since the
first day I met you.

66
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,110
I mean, you were
half-naked, granted.

67
00:05:30,203 --> 00:05:33,079
I know that I kind of blind-sided
you with this, okay?

68
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,749
I mean, it doesn't
have to be tomorrow.

69
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,750
We can take our time.

70
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:48,216
Billy, I can't marry you.

71
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:55,723
I don't know
how else to say it.

72
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:02,230
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:22,583
He pulled out that ring and it
was like an electric shock.

74
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:28,593
I could barely say anything.

75
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:31,972
Well, maybe you're regretting
that you didn't say yes.

76
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:35,851
No. No.

77
00:06:35,852 --> 00:06:39,062
I don't know what to make
of me and Billy,

78
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:43,149
but I know I can't marry him.

79
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,150
Then again, I don't know what
to make of you and me, either.

80
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:04,250
Excuse me.

81
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:24,709
Yeah, sure thing.

82
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,877
Hey, two more.

83
00:08:25,878 --> 00:08:28,171
Coming right up.

84
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:30,632
Ellen.

85
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,884
It's good to see you.

86
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:37,885
It's good to see you, Captain.

87
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,736
Dee.

88
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:52,862
Billy.

89
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:54,781
Didn't know you were
coming down here.

90
00:08:54,782 --> 00:08:57,701
I grabbed a two-day rotation.

91
00:08:57,702 --> 00:09:00,787
I thought I'd grab
some R and R.

92
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:05,788
I'm on business, as usual.

93
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,420
Captain Adama.

94
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:24,561
Oh, I really am an idiot,
aren't I?

95
00:09:24,562 --> 00:09:27,856
No, Billy... Don't.

96
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:29,315
Don't bother.
Can you give us a minute?

97
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:34,279
No, you know what? Have a seat, Captain.
Be my guest.

98
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Billy, I'm sorry.

99
00:09:50,087 --> 00:09:54,215
I thought, if anything, we
were honest with each other.

100
00:09:54,216 --> 00:09:57,177
But you knew you were gonna be here with
him today, and you let me propose to you.

101
00:09:57,178 --> 00:09:58,261
I didn't...

102
00:09:58,262 --> 00:09:59,929
I know that giving you
the ring was stupid.

103
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,640
That's fine.

104
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:07,641
And maybe this wasn't gonna work
out between us. But this...

105
00:10:07,813 --> 00:10:09,647
You should've told me
about this.

106
00:10:09,648 --> 00:10:12,525
Oh, it's hard, you know,

107
00:10:12,526 --> 00:10:15,612
to choose the people
we fall in love with.

108
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:20,158
To love only
one person at a time.

109
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,162
People like us
are more complicated.

110
00:10:24,163 --> 00:10:26,956
Us?

111
00:10:26,957 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:34,001
I'm here with friends.

113
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:39,094
Ellen,
you're a regular here, right?

114
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:43,681
You ever see that woman
before, in the corner?

115
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:45,975
No. Only when I came in.

116
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:50,976
And wondered when they were gonna
start enforcing a dress code.

117
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:04,202
Ellen, the bathroom's
over here.

118
00:11:04,203 --> 00:11:06,579
Are you serious?

119
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,041
Let's go.

120
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:15,042
Lee Adama, you amaze me.

121
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:45,239
This is it now. You ready?

122
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:53,585
Yes.

123
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:58,586
We're with you.

124
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:11,936
Do it!

125
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,780
Everybody by the bar!
Now! Move.

126
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:26,701
You, you! Up against the bar!

127
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:27,911
Oh, my Gods!

128
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:32,912
Three men, one woman,
all armed.

129
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:36,753
Is it true? The Fleet
knows I'm on Galactica?

130
00:12:36,754 --> 00:12:39,464
I'm interested
in navigational weaknesses.

131
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:44,465
Wormholes, dark matter blind spots.
Likely ambushes.

132
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,473
I would avoid these pulsar pointers
because of dradis interference.

133
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:51,392
If I was gonna plan an
ambush, I'd do it there.

134
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:56,064
It depends, Admiral. They
adapt to your every move.

135
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:58,233
Every move triggers
a countermove.

136
00:12:58,234 --> 00:13:01,694
Adapt. That's what
you're good at, right?

137
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:05,740
Why won't you answer
my question?

138
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:10,741
Does the Fleet know
I'm on Galactica?

139
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:18,127
It's the baby. She's kicking.

140
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:22,757
The Fleet knows.
That'll be all for today.

141
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:23,258
Guards.

142
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:44,279
You know, if people knew

143
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,615
how much you've relied on that
thing's so-called intelligence,

144
00:13:47,616 --> 00:13:49,450
they'd be scared
out of their wits.

145
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:54,451
What about you, Saul?
Are you afraid of her?

146
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,040
You know, the truth is I don't like
the way it's gotten under your skin.

147
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:17,562
What are you doing?

148
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:20,398
What are you doing?

149
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,901
The pressure hatch can withstand
explosive decompression.

150
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:28,902
The only way help's getting in is
with a raft of high explosives.

151
00:14:33,954 --> 00:14:37,373
Or we could just let these clowns
open the pressure door for us.

152
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:39,751
There's bound to be a security
force on its way soon.

153
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:42,295
Open the door for us?
Why would they do that?

154
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:43,421
Give me your drink.

155
00:14:43,422 --> 00:14:44,547
Let me talk to them.

156
00:14:44,548 --> 00:14:48,593
The ice. I need the dry ice.

157
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:53,594
Okay, stay calm.

158
00:14:54,808 --> 00:14:56,726
Ellen!

159
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:58,394
Please don't shoot!

160
00:14:58,395 --> 00:14:59,687
Who are you?

161
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:00,772
Ellen Tigh.

162
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:05,773
Get over here now. Move!

163
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:12,408
We are not criminals. We are members
of the Fleet, just like you.

164
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:15,953
My husband's XO of Galactica.

165
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:20,954
You've just made the worst
mistakes of your life.

166
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:28,337
Colonel Tigh, Admiral,
you need to hear this.

167
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,804
ELLEN; Saul.

168
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:34,430
Ellen. What's wrong?

169
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:35,807
They're holding us hostage.

170
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:38,434
They're threatening to kill us!

171
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:41,938
My name is Sesha Abinell.

172
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:46,109
I have seized control
of the Cloud 9 lounge

173
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,485
and held the people in it
hostage.

174
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:49,320
What do you want?

175
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:53,241
What do I want?

176
00:15:53,242 --> 00:15:58,242
This is not about what I want.

177
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:05,165
The Colonial Fleet has become
a Cylon-occupied territory.

178
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:09,132
You are working in collusion
with a Cylon agent.

179
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:11,008
The very same model
of the Cylon

180
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:15,221
that tried to murder you, Admiral
Adama, on your own ship.

181
00:16:15,222 --> 00:16:18,349
We want Sharon Valerii.

182
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,350
You have two hours.

183
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:29,277
Get me everything you can
on Sesha Abinell.

184
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:29,890
Yes, sir.

185
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,166
Sesha Abinell.

186
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:46,502
Fleet records indicate she's
the widow of a Ray Abinell.

187
00:16:46,503 --> 00:16:48,379
He was a casualty aboard
the Greenleaf freighter

188
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,048
when the Cylons hit it
about 10 weeks ago.

189
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:54,510
Widow.

190
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:56,554
Who do we have aboard Cloud 9?

191
00:16:56,555 --> 00:17:01,350
Rotation schedule shows Captain
Adama, half a Marine squad,

192
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:04,228
and Starbuck's already there
on R and R.

193
00:17:04,229 --> 00:17:05,605
Get me Starbuck right away.

194
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:10,318
Yes, sir.

195
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,319
Hell, one of you beauties
has got to be an O2 sensor.

196
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:29,295
And I'm guessing it's you.

197
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:34,296
Take a sip of carbon dioxide.

198
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:43,434
There was another guy
at the bar.

199
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:45,978
Check the back. We don't
want any more mistakes.

200
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:48,606
Kern, there's an awful lot
of military types here.

201
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:53,607
And that's why we're here. To get
Galactica's attention, remember?

202
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:58,324
Page, you go.

203
00:17:58,325 --> 00:18:03,325
No problem.

204
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:13,691
Good to see you, Gunny.

205
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:16,027
I'm gonna need some of those
gorillas you call Marines.

206
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:18,779
Most of my gorillas
are already here, sir.

207
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,364
Just trying to
cop a little R and R.

208
00:19:20,365 --> 00:19:22,450
Tell me about it.

209
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:23,576
All right, here's what we know.

210
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:26,746
We got an unknown number of
shooters, at least 20 hostages,

211
00:19:26,747 --> 00:19:29,790
and about a 90-minute window before
they start throwing out bodies.

212
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,709
You got a plan, sir?

213
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,710
Lock and load. Let's figure
out the rest as we go along.

214
00:19:44,806 --> 00:19:46,724
Put your weapon down!

215
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:48,643
Tell them.

216
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:53,644
He says he's Captain Adama from the Galactica.
He just wants to talk.

217
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:59,691
Talk, that's it. Just talk.

218
00:20:10,082 --> 00:20:11,457
They're together.

219
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:20,758
Put it down or she dies.

220
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:24,387
Hey! She dies,
he dies. You get it?

221
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:29,388
The difference is, you won't do it.
He will.

222
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:50,955
Okay?

223
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:11,559
We all have someone
we care about.

224
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,229
It's his son.

225
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,566
He's not gonna
choose the Cylon over his son.

226
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:23,567
Get in line with the others.

227
00:21:46,678 --> 00:21:49,680
The CO2 is through the roof.

228
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:52,683
They're trying to suffocate us.

229
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:54,351
What is this, a trap?

230
00:21:54,352 --> 00:21:58,481
There's a reason you don't just
start shooting on a spaceship.

231
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:02,234
You probably nicked a line. Why don't
you let me talk to the Admiral,

232
00:22:02,235 --> 00:22:06,655
see if we can't
find a way out of this?

233
00:22:06,656 --> 00:22:11,160
I've got two strike teams inbound to you.
ETA ten minutes.

234
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:13,287
We'll have plenty of
firepower, so that's good,

235
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:15,706
but I'm concerned
with limited access points.

236
00:22:15,707 --> 00:22:20,707
Admiral, it's Abinell.

237
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,716
Keep Starbuck
on the line with us.

238
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:26,926
Adama.

239
00:22:26,927 --> 00:22:28,969
We're losing oxygen.

240
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,970
If it's not restored,
the hostages die.

241
00:22:35,977 --> 00:22:39,647
Then you all die,
because this is over.

242
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:43,984
Not till the Cylon's dead.

243
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:47,154
I'm willing to die
to see this through.

244
00:22:47,155 --> 00:22:52,155
Are you willing
to risk your son's life?

245
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,080
Son of a bitch.

246
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:57,748
Suddenly, you're listening.

247
00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:02,749
Gods damn it! Give her what she wants!
Give her the Cylon!

248
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:05,506
You're all alone on this,
Admiral.

249
00:23:05,507 --> 00:23:10,302
I'm not gonna sacrifice a military
asset on your altar of revenge.

250
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:12,763
What are you talking about?

251
00:23:12,764 --> 00:23:13,806
This isn't...

252
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:17,226
You said this was about
us being played by the Cylons,

253
00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:22,227
but it isn't. It's about the loss of
your husband, and I understand that.

254
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:27,152
It's about you wanting to strike
back, and I understand that, too.

255
00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:31,448
But we've all lost people that we care
about, and we learn to live with it.

256
00:23:31,449 --> 00:23:36,449
I am sure you are aware, Admiral,
of the concrete evidence

257
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:41,917
that Caprica's defenses were
compromised by a Cylon agent

258
00:23:41,918 --> 00:23:45,921
who infiltrated the Ministry of
Defense on the eve of the attacks.

259
00:23:45,922 --> 00:23:50,922
People look for complicated answers
when something terrible happens.

260
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:56,553
Maybe we were just caught by
surprise and were beaten,

261
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:59,226
and maybe we have to learn
to live with that.

262
00:23:59,227 --> 00:24:02,271
And maybe you are
just missing the point.

263
00:24:02,272 --> 00:24:06,317
You were infiltrated.
You, the military.

264
00:24:06,318 --> 00:24:09,445
And you are being
infiltrated again, right now.

265
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:13,365
You can sit there and pretend you know
what you're doing, but you do not.

266
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:15,159
You are being played.

267
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,287
And the rest of us do not want
to go down with your ship.

268
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:20,664
I want this air system
restored right now.

269
00:24:20,665 --> 00:24:24,293
One person comes in alone,
fixes it, leaves.

270
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:29,294
Anything goes wrong, somebody
gets hurt, it's on your head.

271
00:24:35,055 --> 00:24:38,641
Keep a direct line open
to Cloud 9.

272
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:41,268
What do we do?

273
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:46,269
We repair the air system.

274
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:53,948
Saul, we can't give her Sharon.

275
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:56,408
I hope you know that, right?

276
00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:58,577
I know that.

277
00:24:58,578 --> 00:25:00,245
We can't start
dealing with the terrorists.

278
00:25:00,246 --> 00:25:04,750
We start now, it'll open the
floodgates, and it'll never stop.

279
00:25:04,751 --> 00:25:09,751
But, by the way,
it's not Sharon.

280
00:25:10,382 --> 00:25:12,216
It's a frakking Cylon.

281
00:25:12,217 --> 00:25:16,595
You don't think I know that?

282
00:25:16,596 --> 00:25:20,224
I think there's part of you that
looks into that thing's eyes

283
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:23,727
and still sees that young girl
that reported aboard

284
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:26,230
two years ago as a rook pilot.

285
00:25:26,231 --> 00:25:30,859
Well, it's not. It never was.

286
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,863
Bill, it's a machine.

287
00:25:34,864 --> 00:25:39,864
Admiral, it's Captain Thrace.

288
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:41,829
Sitrep.

289
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,414
I had one of the Cloud 9 techs

290
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:45,249
double-check
the oxygen feed in there.

291
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,917
There's nothing wrong
with the air.

292
00:25:46,918 --> 00:25:48,335
Could be a glitch.

293
00:25:48,336 --> 00:25:52,715
Or maybe someone screwed with one
of the CO2 sensors in the bar.

294
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:55,634
Lee? Why?

295
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:57,094
Maybe he's given us an opening.

296
00:25:57,095 --> 00:26:00,014
If I can get someone inside, get a clear
idea of what we're dealing with...

297
00:26:00,015 --> 00:26:03,851
Kara, this is a recon mission.
Get someone to volunteer.

298
00:26:03,852 --> 00:26:05,769
Then you assess the situation,

299
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,063
and then get the hell out of there.
Do you understand?

300
00:26:08,064 --> 00:26:08,676
Yes, sir.

301
00:26:13,778 --> 00:26:18,778
I'm here to repair the O2 line.

302
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,202
Captain, what are you doing?

303
00:26:22,203 --> 00:26:27,203
Volunteering. Let me see that.

304
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:43,265
Close the hatch. Search her.

305
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:48,266
You may not want to do that.
You're running out of air in here.

306
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:16,006
Looks clean.

307
00:27:16,007 --> 00:27:20,135
Do your job.

308
00:27:20,136 --> 00:27:25,136
Cover her.

309
00:27:32,774 --> 00:27:37,774
Wait a minute.
Turn around, slowly.

310
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:43,029
Check the box again.

311
00:27:52,085 --> 00:27:53,877
We're hot! Let's go! Hurry!

312
00:27:53,878 --> 00:27:58,878
Get down! Get down!

313
00:28:16,734 --> 00:28:21,734
We gotta get out now! Come on!

314
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:00,485
Billy, Billy.

315
00:29:00,486 --> 00:29:05,486
I need shirts, towels, anything
I can use as a bandage.

316
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:10,371
Billy!

317
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:18,837
Nobody said you could move.

318
00:29:18,838 --> 00:29:21,632
You still want the Cylon?
Do you?

319
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:24,009
Because if the Admiral's son dies,
you're not gonna get a deal.

320
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,636
You get that?

321
00:29:25,637 --> 00:29:29,806
If he dies, you're not
gonna get what you want.

322
00:29:29,807 --> 00:29:34,807
He's right. Let him go.

323
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:51,328
Sir, it's Starbuck.

324
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:54,081
We got a report of gunshots.
What's happening?

325
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:57,793
My cover was blown.
I had to move. I'm sorry.

326
00:29:57,794 --> 00:29:59,670
Any casualties?

327
00:29:59,671 --> 00:30:04,671
Two Marines, probably KIA,

328
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:11,014
at least one of the gunmen,

329
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:11,559
and Lee.

330
00:30:17,855 --> 00:30:22,401
It was crazy in there,
confused, and he got hit.

331
00:30:22,402 --> 00:30:23,944
How bad?

332
00:30:23,945 --> 00:30:26,113
I don't know.

333
00:30:26,114 --> 00:30:27,864
Stand by.

334
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:30,826
Hold your position. Make no
move unless you hear from me.

335
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:33,662
It was friendly fire.

336
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:37,833
Lee got hit by friendly fire.

337
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:42,834
I think it was me.

338
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:50,049
You have your orders.

339
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:57,144
I can't stop the bleeding.

340
00:30:57,145 --> 00:31:01,732
What can I do?
I can't stop the bleeding.

341
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:04,318
I gotta stop the bleeding.

342
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:07,821
I can't tell
if it hit an artery.

343
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:11,033
Lee, don't leave me.

344
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:14,661
Lee. Lee, don't leave me, okay?

345
00:31:14,662 --> 00:31:15,746
Please.

346
00:31:15,747 --> 00:31:17,414
Hey.

347
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:21,418
He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be okay.

348
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:26,419
He's gonna be okay. Just hang in there.
Come on.

349
00:31:27,425 --> 00:31:32,425
Stay with me. Stay with me, Lee.
Stay with me.

350
00:31:51,657 --> 00:31:56,244
Are you playing with us?
Are you playing with me?

351
00:31:56,245 --> 00:32:01,245
I've saved the ship, saved you,

352
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:03,502
how many times now?

353
00:32:03,503 --> 00:32:06,296
Five? Six?

354
00:32:06,297 --> 00:32:09,091
You just can't believe
I'm not playing against you.

355
00:32:09,092 --> 00:32:12,177
You know that there are
Cylons within this Fleet.

356
00:32:12,178 --> 00:32:15,472
You know what they look like.
You know where to find them.

357
00:32:15,473 --> 00:32:20,473
If I were to ask you, would
you tell me who they are?

358
00:32:21,813 --> 00:32:22,313
No.

359
00:32:27,693 --> 00:32:32,693
That I believe.

360
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:47,041
He'll be all right.

361
00:32:48,047 --> 00:32:49,631
Thanks for the concern.

362
00:32:49,632 --> 00:32:53,844
She loses a husband and suddenly
the world owes her an explanation.

363
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:56,721
He was a good man.

364
00:32:56,722 --> 00:33:00,142
And he wasn't just her husband.
He was my brother.

365
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:05,143
My brother died on Picon.
He was a good man, too.

366
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:10,481
They're all good men.

367
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:14,364
The Abinell woman sent over
a manifesto to the press

368
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:16,575
before they took over the bar.

369
00:33:16,576 --> 00:33:19,536
It's mostly a collection of
rumor and conspiracy theories

370
00:33:19,537 --> 00:33:22,038
about Cylons in the military
and the government.

371
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,206
Bunch of crap.

372
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:26,084
It's getting a lot of attention. We
gotta get our people out of there.

373
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:27,752
You have Marines on Cloud 9.

374
00:33:27,753 --> 00:33:30,839
The pressure door to the room
has been resealed.

375
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,508
If we try blowing it open,
we'll need so much G4

376
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:35,927
we'd risk killing
everyone inside.

377
00:33:35,928 --> 00:33:39,222
There are no options left
except for one.

378
00:33:39,223 --> 00:33:42,392
No. We don't strike deals
with terrorists. We can't.

379
00:33:42,393 --> 00:33:45,061
We give them Sharon Valerii,
we're inviting terrorism,

380
00:33:45,062 --> 00:33:48,231
and we weaken our position permanently.
You know that.

381
00:33:48,232 --> 00:33:49,900
Gentlemen,
everyone in that room

382
00:33:49,901 --> 00:33:53,487
is someone's son, someone's
wife, someone's mother.

383
00:33:53,488 --> 00:33:57,073
Billy is the closest thing that I
have to family left in this world.

384
00:33:57,074 --> 00:34:00,827
And if you don't think that that
confuses things emotionally for me...

385
00:34:00,828 --> 00:34:01,912
Let's not be naive.

386
00:34:01,913 --> 00:34:04,706
What if they're right?

387
00:34:04,707 --> 00:34:06,708
What if Sharon has been
playing us all,

388
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:08,960
plotting our destruction
with every passing day?

389
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:11,213
What if the terrorists
are right?

390
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:14,925
This isn't about Sharon. It's about
something much bigger than that.

391
00:34:14,926 --> 00:34:16,968
It's about
the long-term survival.

392
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:20,347
It's about the way we conduct
ourselves in all of this.

393
00:34:20,348 --> 00:34:25,348
Sir, it's Abinell on the line.

394
00:34:26,437 --> 00:34:27,812
How's my son?

395
00:34:27,813 --> 00:34:31,733
Alive, but my friend is dead.

396
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:35,779
So are two of your soldiers.
And your son's dying.

397
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,407
You know, I thought
a long time about this.

398
00:34:39,408 --> 00:34:43,870
About what I'd do.
About how far I'd go.

399
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:48,750
And I honestly did not know
until this moment...

400
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:52,003
Two.

401
00:34:52,004 --> 00:34:54,548
What? What?

402
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:55,632
Get on your feet.

403
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:56,800
What are you going to do?

404
00:34:56,801 --> 00:35:00,136
Saul! Give them what they want!

405
00:35:00,137 --> 00:35:04,057
It's just a machine!

406
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:07,143
Oh, no. Oh, no. No!

407
00:35:07,144 --> 00:35:10,814
They're gonna kill her.

408
00:35:10,815 --> 00:35:15,110
Hold your fire.

409
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:18,947
I'm giving you the Cylon,

410
00:35:18,948 --> 00:35:20,365
but she won't be alive.

411
00:35:20,366 --> 00:35:22,867
What does that mean?
That is not the deal.

412
00:35:22,868 --> 00:35:27,080
It means that you've convinced
me that we may have been played.

413
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:29,916
And if that be the case, and
she's been playing with me,

414
00:35:29,917 --> 00:35:34,129
then I can't take any more chances.
So you make up your mind.

415
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,716
If you want Sharon Valerii,
you can have her,

416
00:35:37,717 --> 00:35:40,260
but on my terms.

417
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:45,261
I give you the body,
you give me the hostages.

418
00:35:47,602 --> 00:35:48,102
Done.

419
00:35:53,357 --> 00:35:58,357
Cut the wire.

420
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:19,170
It's good.

421
00:36:19,258 --> 00:36:24,258
Coast looks clear.

422
00:36:39,195 --> 00:36:44,195
Admiral. Let me help, please.

423
00:36:44,617 --> 00:36:48,912
Let me take it from here.

424
00:36:48,913 --> 00:36:49,525
Let's go.

425
00:37:00,424 --> 00:37:05,424
Stop looking at him, Billy.

426
00:37:05,513 --> 00:37:09,599
Loan see you watching him. I know
you think you can get that gun.

427
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,601
I'm only thinking
in case something happens.

428
00:37:11,602 --> 00:37:15,939
No. You're not a soldier.

429
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,776
You're not trained for that.
You've got nothing to prove.

430
00:37:19,777 --> 00:37:20,277
I know.

431
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,790
They're right outside. We open
up, they'll give us the body.

432
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:35,625
Okay.

433
00:37:35,626 --> 00:37:37,293
We're opening the door.

434
00:37:37,294 --> 00:37:40,130
But if anything goes wrong,
we start killing hostages.

435
00:37:40,131 --> 00:37:40,631
Do it.

436
00:38:23,007 --> 00:38:25,091
It's over.

437
00:38:25,092 --> 00:38:28,303
Wait.

438
00:38:28,304 --> 00:38:33,304
This isn't right.

439
00:38:39,523 --> 00:38:43,902
This one's been dead for weeks.

440
00:38:43,903 --> 00:38:48,615
Their Cylon is still alive.

441
00:38:48,616 --> 00:38:53,616
Kill the girlfriend.

442
00:39:18,354 --> 00:39:22,357
Down! Report!

443
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:23,566
We're contained!

444
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:24,734
All clear!

445
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:26,694
All right, we're all clear.
Grab this tight!

446
00:39:26,695 --> 00:39:29,823
I need help over here!

447
00:39:29,824 --> 00:39:34,824
Bring in the ER team.

448
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:36,454
Medic, get in here now! Medic!

449
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:38,331
Far side of the room.
Right over there.

450
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:42,418
Lee. Lee, can you hear me? Lee!

451
00:39:42,419 --> 00:39:43,795
- Blood pressure.
- Right.

452
00:39:43,796 --> 00:39:48,716
Can you hear me, Lee? Come on, Son.
Come on, hurry up!

453
00:39:48,717 --> 00:39:52,262
BP's weak and threading.

454
00:39:55,307 --> 00:39:56,558
That's good.

455
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,770
Billy. Billy.

456
00:40:00,771 --> 00:40:01,271
Billy.

457
00:40:12,616 --> 00:40:14,909
Billy.

458
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:15,410
Billy.

459
00:40:56,076 --> 00:40:59,078
Is this what you gave them?

460
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:02,916
It was a calculated risk.

461
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:07,917
It wasn't worth it.

462
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:46,071
Oh, dear.

463
00:41:52,716 --> 00:41:57,716
There, that's better.
That's better.

464
00:41:57,846 --> 00:41:59,180
He was so young.

465
00:42:16,573 --> 00:42:18,533
Hey.

466
00:42:18,534 --> 00:42:21,953
Hey.

467
00:42:21,954 --> 00:42:23,663
What is it?

468
00:42:23,664 --> 00:42:26,708
Nothing.

469
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:30,253
When you're feeling better,
we can talk.

470
00:42:30,254 --> 00:42:32,505
It was a hell of a vacation.

471
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:33,006
Yeah.

472
00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:45,101
Lee?

473
00:42:45,102 --> 00:42:48,604
Lee, you can't leave.

474
00:42:48,605 --> 00:42:52,066
You have to stay.

475
00:42:52,067 --> 00:42:57,067
You have to really stay.
You understand?

476
00:43:05,622 --> 00:43:07,790
It's okay.

477
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:11,961
I'll be here when you wake up.

478
00:43:11,962 --> 00:43:16,962
I'll be right here.
